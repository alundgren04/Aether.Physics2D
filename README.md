# XFarseer Physics

Box2D is the foundational physics engine, which was then ported to C# as Farseer and evolved independently. Farseer is now abandoned and lives on in Aether.Physics2D, which is still maintained as of Nov 2018. This is a fork of Aether.Physics2D which is enhanced to include further optimizations specifically for a huge, expansive world.

# Added Features

- Ability to load a R.U.B.E. (Really Useful Box2D Editor) world via JSON. 
- Additional test bed cases to benchmark performance of very large worlds.
